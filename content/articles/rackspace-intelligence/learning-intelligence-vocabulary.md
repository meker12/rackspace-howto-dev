To tell Rackspace Intelligence which aspects of your configuration to
monitor for you, you define your objectives in the following terms:

-   *Entities* to be monitored\
     For example, you can define a cloud server as an entity.\
      
-   *Checks* that focus on a particular aspect of an entity's behavior\
     For example, a check can monitor a cloud server's RAM usage.\
      
-   *Alarms* that define the limits of the entity's behavior\
     For example, alarm criteria identify whether RAM usage is in one of
    the following states: OK, WARNING, or CRITICAL.\
      
-   *Alerts* that announce when a monitored entity has triggered an
    alarm\
     For example, an alert reports that RAM usage has reached the
    CRITICAL level.\
      
-   *Notification plans* that define how to communicate alerts\
     For example, a notification plan requests notification of the help
    desk and the on-call system administrator. \
      
-   *Notifications* that define the contact information used in
    notification plans\
     For example, notifications to the on-call system administrator are
    sent as text messages to a specific telephone number. \
      
-   *Visualizations* that present data meaningfully\
     For example, a RAM usage graph shows growth leading up to the
    triggered alarm.

&ldquo;Single Pane of Glas&rdquo; for Your IT
Ops](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/cloud-monitoring/) discusses these
concepts in the context of Cloud Monitoring. Rackspace Intelligence acts
as a dashboard to help you interact with data collected by Cloud
Monitoring.
